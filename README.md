> A tic-tac-toe game made in ruby.

## Language
- Ruby

## Getting started
In order to play the game:

1. You need to have ruby environment installed. [Click here for instructions](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
2. Clone this repository `https://github.com/bettercallazamat/tic-tac-toe-game-ruby.git`
3. Inside tic-tac-toe-game directory run `./bin/main.rb`

## Instructions
- The goal of tic-tac-toe is to be the first player to get three in a row on a 3-by-3 grid
- The first player who is playing X always goes first.
- Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board until either player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally or until all squares on the grid are filled.

### How to win?
If a player is able to draw three Xs or three Os in a row, then that player wins.

### When is a draw?
If all squares are filled and neither player has made a complete row of Xs or Os, then the game is a draw.
